Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:


why do we need data structure?
Ans: Data Structure is needed to find out ways in which  data is arranged in a computer's memory or stored on disk.
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Ans:
1.Design Operating System
2.Database Management System
3.Statistical analysis package
4.Numerical Analysis
5.Graphics
6.Artificial Intelligence
7.Simulation
what is an Array?
Ans: An array is a data structure that stores a collection of values of the same type.You access each individual value
through an integer index.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans: The difference between an Array and ArrayList is that an Array is a fixed length data structure while ArrayList
is a variable length collection class. Primitives cannot be stored in ArrayList, it can only contain objects and Array
can contain both primitive and object in Java.
what is LinkedList?
Ans: Linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (which is called a
node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node.
what is queue?
Ans: A queue is a data structure that is somewhat like a stack, except that in a queue the first item inserted is the
first to be removed.
what is stack?
Ans: A stack allows access to only one data item that is the last item inserted.If you remove this item, you can access
the next-to-last item inserted, and so on.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans: FIFO- First In First Out
LIFO- Last In First Out
what is the order of complexity?
Ans: It is finding the upper limit for the growth of some function.
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Ans: The best case on occurs when the desired element is the first element.
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Ans: It is typically impossible to determine the exact worst-case scenario.
what is tree in data structure?
Ans: A tree is a data structure consisting of nodes organized as a hierarchy.
what is graph in data structure?
Ans: Graph is a data structure that consists of two components. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes and
A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge.
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Ans: HashMap is non synchronized and not thread safe. HashTable is thread safe and synchronized.
HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values, while HashTable do not allow null keys and null values
in the HashTable object.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Ans:  RDBMS – Array (Array of structures)
      Network data model – Graph
      Hierarchical data model – Trees
How HashMap works in java?
Ans: HashMap internally stores mapping in the form of Map.Entry object which contains both key and value object.
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Ans: An object of this class is thrown when code accesses an array with an illegal index. This happens when an index
is negative or greater than or equal to the length of the array being indexed.
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Ans:
1.Define a new array, allocate space for the new array, copy initial values of the array with arraycopy.
2.Define a new vector, allocate space for the new array, copy values from the initial array.
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Ans: Array is linear data structure. Linked list is linear and non-linear data structure.Array elements cannot be added,
deleted once it is declared. The nodes in the linked list can be added and deleted from the list.
What is DFS and BFS?
Ans: DFS Depth First Search and BFS Breadth First Search are search algorithms used for graphs and trees.
What is Recursion?
Ans: Recursion is a programming technique in which a method calls itself.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Ans: Big O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It specifically describes
the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used  in memory or
on disk by an algorithm.
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Ans:               Best case     Average case     Worst case
Selection sort     O(n^2)        O(n^2)           O(n^2)
Insertion sort     O(n)          O(n^2)           O(n^2)
Merge sort         O(n log n)    O(n log n)       O(n log n)
Quick sort         O(n log n)    O(n log n)       O(n^2)
Bubble sort        O(n^2)        O(n^2)           O(n^2)
Heap sort          O(n log n)    O(n log n)       O(n log n)
Bucket Sort        O(n • k)      O(n 2 )           O(n • k)
Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
